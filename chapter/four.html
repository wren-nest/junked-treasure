    <div class="ceres">Are you sure you remember where you left it?</div>
	<div class="sync">Not at all!</div>
    <div class="ceres">Ha ha, I expected as much.</div>
	<div class="sync">This always happens, doesn’t it.</div>
    <div class="ceres">Don’t worry. I think I saw something strange around here earlier.</div>
	<div class="sync">Oh, do you think it was my treasure?</div>
    <div class="ceres">Maybe.</div>
    <div class="ceres">And even if it isn’t, we won’t go home empty handed.</div>
	<div class="sync">I like that plan.</div>
	<img src="https://wren-nest.github.io/junked-treasure/images/understone.webp">
	<div class="sync">This is it!</div>
    <div class="ceres">This is it?</div>
	<div class="sync">It is!</div>
    <div class="ceres">Ah, I’m glad.</div>
	<div class="sync">I’m glad you saw it too, I never would have seen it again otherwise.</div>
    <div class="ceres">I’m sure you would have found it again.</div>
	<div class="sync">Do you know what it is?</div>
    <div class="ceres">Do you?</div>
	<div class="sync">No clue! Isn’t that exciting?</div>
    <div class="ceres">I think you’ll find this even more exciting.</div>

    <div class="sync">Wow. It’s really...? Wow.</div>
    <div class="ceres">Alright, I’m a little rusty.</div>
	<div class="sync">No, it’s really cool.</div>
    <div class="sync">Maybe we should leave it here.</div>
    <div class="ceres">Hey! I just need a little more practice.</div>
	<div class="sync">Ha, alright. Let’s take it in. </div>
    <div class="ceres">You mean it’s time for me to take it in?</div>
	<div class="sync">Hey, I’ll help! A little. If you really need.</div>
    <div class="ceres">Ha ha ha…</div>
    <div class="ceres">No worries, no worries.</div>
	<div class="sync">Ok, phew, cuz that looks really heavy.</div>
    <div class="ceres">It’s nothing, really.</div>
    <div class="ceres">Light- as a feather!</div>
    <img src="https://wren-nest.github.io/junked-treasure/images/home1.webp">
    <div class="ceres">Wow, those are looking nice!</div>
	<div class="sync">Thanks!</div>
    <div class="sync">It’s a little hard to get them lined up just right.</div>
    <div class="ceres">You’re doing a great job, considering you’re doing it all midair. I don’t know how you’ve gotten it as straight as it is. You really got some legs on you.</div>
	<div class="sync">That’s the rabbit in me, hey?</div>
    <div class="ceres">Mm-hm.</div>
	<div class="sync">Say, what do you think should go after this one?</div>
	<div class="sync">I was thinking the pearl, but it’s a tad small.</div>
    <div class="ceres">Maybe this?</div>
	<div class="sync">A spoon?!</div>
	<div class="sync">No way.</div>
    <div class="ceres">Why not?</div>
	<div class="sync">It doesn’t fit the theme at all.</div>
    <div class="ceres">Oh, there’s a theme?</div>
	<div class="sync">Of course.</div>
    <div class="sync">Can you guess what it is.</div>
    <div class="ceres">I don’t think so.</div>
    <div class="ceres">Anyway, we couldn’t hang this up, I still need it.</div>
	<div class="sync">Oh? Are you cooking something?</div>
    <div class="ceres">No, I’m a knight.</div>
	<div class="sync">I see, I see.</div>
	<div class="sync">Are you going to fight a dragon?</div>
    <div class="ceres">No, no.</div>
    <div class="ceres">I’d much rather befriend one, anyway.</div>
    <div class="ceres">No, I’m going to get out whatever ghost is possessing this piano.</div>
	<div class="sync">Ha ha, is that so?</div>
    <div class="ceres">Yes. I’ve been working on it all day and it’s still out of tune.</div>
    <div class="ceres">I’m resorting to supernatural intervention.</div>
    <div class="sync">How is a knight going to defeat a ghost?</div>
    <div class="ceres">I’m not sure, but they’d have a better shot at it than I do.</div>
    <div class="sync">Fair enough!</div>
    <div class="sync">I sure wouldn’t like to face a poltergeist unarmed.</div>
    <div class="ceres">Precisely my thinking.</div>
    <div class="ceres">.</div>
    <div class="ceres">.</div>
    <div class="ceres">.</div>
    <div class="ceres">Hm… speaking of cooking.</div>
    <div class="sync">Oh?</div>
    <div class="sync">Oh yes, it is about that time.</div>
    <div class="ceres">I just had an idea.</div>
    <div class="sync">A tasty idea?</div>
    <div class="ceres">The tastiest.</div>
    <img src="https://wren-nest.github.io/junked-treasure/images/bake.webp">
    <div class="sync">One more?</div>
    <div class="ceres">Two, maybe.</div>
    <div class="ceres">Maybe three.</div>
    <div class="sync">Gosh, really? </div>
    <div class="sync">Alright.</div>
    <div class="ceres">Nearly done now…</div>
    <div class="sync">And then I can put on my roses?</div>
    <div class="ceres">Yes, that’s the last step.</div>
    <div class="sync">I didn’t do too badly with them, this time.</div>
    <div class="ceres">You always make them beautifully.</div>
    <div class="sync">They’re a little prettier every time. </div>
    <div class="ceres">That’s also true.</div>
    <div class="ceres">Practice makes progress.</div>
    <div class="sync">Perfect, you mean.</div>
    <div class="ceres">No, I wouldn’t eat a perfect flower. No matter how delicious my pastry is.</div>
    <div class="sync">It is pretty tasty.</div>
    <div class="ceres">Thank you.</div>

	<div class="sync">We cooked too much food again, didn’t we?</div>
    <div class="ceres">That’s alright, we always do.</div>
