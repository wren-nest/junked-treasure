    <div class="sync">I've been reading, um... this book, which is basically just an exploration of grief.</div>
    <div class="sync">So it's a drama where Alex dies in a motorbike accident where Efe was on the back.</div>
    <div class="ceres">Damn.</div>
    <div class="sync">And Alex dies in that accident and Efe survives.</div>
    <div class="ceres">That's rough.</div>
    <div class="sync">And spends a while in hospital, obviously, because he got injured as well.</div>
    <div class="sync">Um...</div>
    <div class="sync">Basically, the way it's told is each chapter's from a new character's point of view.</div>
    <div class="sync">And it jumps around through time as well.</div>
    <div class="sync">So the first one starts with Makena's point of view.</div>
    <div class="sync">And it's the first time he sees Efe smile again.</div>
    <div class="sync">A couple months after the fact.</div>
    <div class="sync">And he's taken aback by it.</div>
    <div class="sync">But so happy that he's able to smile and laugh again after this.</div>
    <div class="sync">The second one is, I think, a bit earlier.</div>
    <div class="sync">And it's Kai's working a late night shift at a restaurant.</div>
    <div class="sync">And Efe shows up in the middle of the night at 2am or whatever.</div>
    <div class="sync">And he's woken up from a nightmare.</div>
    <div class="sync">And he just wanted to go see Kai, so he did.</div>
    <div class="sync">And it's just him.</div>
    <div class="sync">And he texts Ari and is just like, Don't worry, he's here.</div>
    <div class="sync">Because obviously, everyone's looking out for him and not sure where he would have gone.</div>
    <div class="sync">And the next one is Sunny's perspective on the night that it happened.</div>
    <div class="sync">And he...</div>
    <div class="sync">It's him.</div>
    <div class="sync">He's the youngest character, he's like 15 or 16 at the time.</div>
    <div class="ceres">Man.</div>
    <div class="sync">And it's them trying to coordinate getting everyone together because Sunny's at university because he's a child prodigy.</div>
    <div class="sync">And he needs to be picked up from university by one of the gang.</div>
    <div class="sync">But everyone's sort of scattered because they're all trying to go to the hospital, go see Efe.</div>
    <div class="sync">And they're trying to get Sunny.</div>
    <div class="sync">And Sunny's just sitting there like, I'm a medical student.</div>
    <div class="sync">I'm just picturing everything that could have happened in my head.</div>
    <div class="sync">And Efe's state is still tenuous.</div>
    <div class="sync">And they didn't even know if Alex was dead at that point.</div>
    <div class="sync">And that was the next one.</div>
    <div class="sync">And then the one after that is the night they get him back from the hospital.</div>
    <div class="sync">It's a conversation between Ari and Zuri.</div>
    <div class="sync">And like...</div>
    <div class="sync">Ari...</div>
    <div class="sync">Sorry, Zuri just being like to Ari, you don't have to hold everything together.</div>
    <div class="sync">Like, we're all here in this moment.</div>
    <div class="sync">Anyway, I just...</div>
    <div class="sync">It's such a well-written thing.</div>
    <div class="sync">And it doesn't explain everything to you.</div>
    <div class="sync">And it's really well-written for that.</div>
    <div class="sync">And the way that it jumps around through all these different perspectives.</div>
    <div class="sync">But you can...</div>
    <div class="sync">It creates this cohesive picture.</div>
    <div class="sync">And some chapters are really long.</div>
    <div class="sync">And some chapters are really short.</div>
    <div class="sync">Like, the Sunny one was very short.</div>
    <div class="sync">And it's all held together by this sadness and grief.</div>
    <div class="sync">But also love.</div>
    <div class="ceres">Mm.</div>
    <div class="sync">That they all have for each other.</div>
    <div class="sync">That you can tell that they have for each other.</div>
    <div class="sync">And I just think it's a really unique story.</div>
    <div class="sync">And I really like the way it's told.</div>
    <div class="ceres">Yeah.</div>
